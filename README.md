## Features

### **Real-time Communication**

The real-time communication feature in this application allows users to instantly send and receive messages or updates without delays. This means conversations, notifications, or data updates happen immediately, creating a smooth and interactive experience like chatting live with someone or seeing updates as they happen. üöÄ

**ADD TECHNICAL INFORMATION AS IT TRANSPIRES**

### **Secure Login**

The Secure Login feature ensures that users can safely access their accounts without worrying about security risks. It protects passwords, prevents unauthorised access, and keeps user data safe while logging in.

**Technical Details**

- Passwords are encrypted using Bcrypt, making them extremely difficult to crack.
- Sessions are used to keep users logged in securely without needing to enter their credentials repeatedly.
- This approach helps prevent attacks like password theft and session hijacking, ensuring a safe login experience.


### **Striking Visuals**

**Design & Layout**

The design and layout of the application have been created from scratch with the user's device in mind. It prioritises a clean, intuitive interface that adapts to different screen sizes and devices. By considering the available space and screen shape, the design ensures that key features are easily accessible, content is well-organised, and the user experience is smooth and engaging. Whether on mobile or desktop, the layout is responsive, ensuring a consistent, user-friendly experience across all platforms.

**Color Scheme & Psychology**

Our curated color scheme features three main colors: pink, purple, and orange, each chosen for their psychological impact and how they complement the overall user experience.

- Purple evokes a sense of luxury, sophistication, and calmness. It adds depth and a touch of elegance to the design, making the interface feel premium yet approachable.
- Orange represents energy, enthusiasm, and positivity. It captures attention and promotes a sense of excitement and action, motivating users to interact with the application.
- Pink is often associated with warmth, compassion, and creativity. It helps create a welcoming, friendly atmosphere, encouraging users to feel comfortable and engaged.

These colors were selected not only for their aesthetic appeal but also for their ability to evoke emotions that align with our vision for the project and user experience.

**Light & Dark Mode**

The light and dark modes allow users to switch between a white or black background, while also shifting the brightness of the color scheme. This adjusts the hues of the pink, purple, and orange tones to create a more balanced and comfortable experience, whether in bright or low-light environments.

## Accessibility

Our app is committed to ensuring an inclusive and accessible experience for all users. Below are the key features and tools we've implemented to meet a range of accessibility needs:

- **Wave Extension**
We use the Wave Extension to evaluate and highlight various accessibility criteria across the app. This helps us identify and address potential issues such as missing alt text, color contrast problems, and navigational challenges, ensuring compliance with accessibility standards.

- **Contrast Checkers**
To ensure text and background elements are easily distinguishable for users with visual impairments, we employ contrast checkers. These tools help us maintain proper contrast ratios between colors, improving readability for those with color blindness or low vision.

- **ARIA Labels**
We implement ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) labels throughout the app. These labels enhance screen reader support by providing additional context to interactive elements, ensuring that users with visual impairments can easily navigate and understand the content.

- **Keyboard Navigation**
Our app supports full keyboard navigation, allowing users to interact with all features without relying on a mouse. This benefits users with motor impairments who may find using a mouse challenging.

- **Customisable Text Sizes**
We offer options to adjust text size for users with visual impairments, providing a more personalised and accessible reading experience.

- **Alt Text for Images**
All images within the app are equipped with descriptive alt text, allowing users with screen readers to understand the content and context of each image.

- **Consistent Layout and Structure**
The app‚Äôs layout and structure are designed for consistency, making it easier for users to understand and navigate through headings, buttons, and links. This reduces cognitive load and ensures a smooth experience for users with learning disabilities.

By implementing these features, we strive to create a more accessible environment for all users, regardless of their abilities.
